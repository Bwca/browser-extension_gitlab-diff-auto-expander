# gitlab-diff-auto-expander
Automatically expand collapsed differences as they load

Created to compensate gitlab's lack of option to display all collapsed files in changes tab by default. Install, switch on and off by clicking the icon. 

The extension iterates over all 'This diff is collapsed. Click to expand it' links, clicking them to request full file versions.
